# Light Luna

**Orbit. Observe. Defend.**  
**Intelligent Software Firewall & Autonomous Defense**  
*A Light Family product by THAI DUY Digital*  
**Status:** Architecture baseline plus an experimental **non-enforcing P0 policy/CLI scaffold**, 2026-10-13. **No working firewall, nft apply, service, cloud, live ban or standalone acceptance is claimed.**

Light Luna is a packaged **software firewall** for Linux servers and future compatible security appliances. It combines traditional, predictable firewall controls with **Luna Brain**, a bounded, evidence-driven security decision system. It works without Cloud, NetBird or Luna Brain. **Development is strictly standalone-first**: implement, package and prove the independent firewall before initiating ANY NetBird connector development. NetBird is a later optional integration, not an early development track.

## Product principles

1. **Firewall first:** deterministic rules, aliases, stateful filtering, zones, interfaces, NAT where applicable, schedules, audit and recoverable configuration; AI is optional.
2. **Install anywhere, select deployment mode:** **Host** (local protection), **Edge** (log/telemetry controller with remote agents, not necessarily inline) and **Gateway** (routing/forwarding appliance, optional for compatible hardware). Mode is a configuration, not a separate codebase.
3. **Defense in depth:** L3/L4 firewall + layer-7 WAF/reverse-proxy adapters + optional IDS/IPS + Luna Brain.
4. **Autonomy with bounded authority:** detect → investigate → decide → independent policy gate → execute → verify → learn; every execution has provenance, expiry, replay protection and rollback.
5. **Offline-first safety:** no dependency on an external API or LLM to permit routine traffic; existing policies and ban expirations continue if Cloud fails.
6. **Strict development order:** standalone Host/Edge firewall + WebUI/CLI + installer + tests first; demonstrate operational standalone acceptance before starting NetBird integration. NetBird API research is parked reference material only until that gate.
7. **Non-invasive coexistence:** never flush other components' firewall tables, interrupt Docker/NetBird/UFW/Cloud security groups, or disable NetBird ACL enforcement as a workaround.
8. **Privacy and provenance:** source IP, proxy identity, version-to-CVE applicability, learning labels and telemetry gaps must be explicit; no default sharing of raw logs or customer IP histories to Cloud.
9. **Releasable product:** two-architecture signed packages, clean install/upgrade/uninstall, service watchdog, safe migrations, rollback, supply-chain attestations and compatibility matrix.

## Naming

**Product:** Light Luna (two words). **Brain:** Luna Brain. **Cloud:** Light Luna Cloud. **CLI:** `lunactl`. **Privileged executor:** `lunalockd` (working name). **System agent:** `luna-agent` (working name). **Appliance:** Light Luna Box. **Firmware/project image:** Light Luna OS (future, only after hardware feasibility).

## Mandatory stage gate — standalone first

**Stage A (ACTIVE PLAN):** Build and prove Light Luna as a self-contained firewall. Host and Edge must work without NetBird installed, without NetBird APIs, and without any NetBird dependency. Complete local rules, aliases, policy compiler, agent/executor, WebUI/CLI, packaging, recovery and standalone end-to-end tests first.

**Stage B (LATER, BLOCKED):** Only after a documented standalone working build passes the exit criteria in [`docs/11-ROADMAP.md`](docs/11-ROADMAP.md) **and the owner authorizes the next phase**, begin engineering and testing the optional NetBird connector. Until then: **no NetBird integration code, API probing, access tokens, compatibility tests or modification to the existing NetBird stack**. Existing public documentation research may remain in this repository as future design reference.

## Current boundaries

- This repository now includes an **experimental, non-enforcing policy validator and CLI preview only**. No nft compiler/apply, WAF engine, privileged daemon, installer, infrastructure, logo asset or working firewall exists.
- Existing Luna/Selene Sentinel work is **research input**; do not copy live logs, agent memory databases, credentials, user data or production automation into this repository.
- Existing production Light Remote, NetBird, VPS-ARM, HOMESV and VPS-AMD are **out of scope for rule changes** until a lab and owner-approved rollout plan are ready. NetBird integration development itself is **out of scope until standalone gate acceptance**.
- Licensing, product name/trademark/domain availability, commercial Cloud terms, and vendor integration obligations remain subject to review.
